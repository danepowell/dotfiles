On MacOS, update emacs to 25 using `brew cask install emacs`.

Emacs requires the following packages, which can be installed using the new built-in package manager (M-x package-install):
* auto-complete
* json-mode
* markdown-mode
* php-mode
* yaml-mode

Donâ€™t forget that the package manager needs to be refreshed periodically (i.e. if a package cannot be found.)
